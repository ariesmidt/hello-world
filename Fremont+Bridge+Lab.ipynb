    "* Because my code is not super in-depth, the statistics that I have available to me are not widespread. However, I can still determine that there are more east bikers than there are west bikers going across the Fremont Bridge every day.\n",
    "* I also find it interesting that we wrote down east and west crossings when the Fremont Bridge actually travels north-south.\n",
    "* Other effects that might play a role in crossings both directions would be traffic during the day. If there is a lot of bicycle traffic going one direction, then maybe some people carpool or bus with their bike stored to get to work, and then they bike home after the traffic is not as bad\n",
    "* Another effect could be time of day. If it's too early to ride your bike to work, just take a lime bike home from work and now that's another crossing in one direction but not the other\n",
    "* The point is that there are many ways to get from one point to the next that might play a role in determining the overall numbers of crossings in each direction. Whatever these specific things might be, there are more people travelling east (which I think is actually north)"
